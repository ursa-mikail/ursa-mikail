# Hi, I'm Ursa!

![Who Am I?](images/blob.gif)

I am an author of 12 [books](https://mikail-eliyah.medium.com/book-list-620d73b2aef2).
I am a scientist. My students called me, Dr [Ursa](https://mikail-eliyah.medium.com/book-list-620d73b2aef2).

I write about life experiences sometimes: [*Architecture Of Our Lives*](https://mikail-eliyah.medium.com/the-art-of-architecting-our-lives-6efcbb4fc67a).
